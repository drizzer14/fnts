TypeScript / JavaScript functional programming utilities inspired by the
[fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) specification and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) programming language.

## Installation

**TypeScript 5.0 is required for this package's typings to work properly.**

```shell
npm i fnts
```

```shell
yarn add fnts
```

## Usage

Please, visit the [documentation](https://drizzer14.github.io/fnts) to obtain the information about the usage and API of `fnts`.

## Motivation

This project was made as a fun exercise around functional programming
principles. It comes nowhere near more serious projects described below as
alternatives, so treat it as the utility toy facilitating the approach to FP
in TypeScript.

## Alternatives

These projects would give you a decent representation of concepts `fnts`
tried to implement and compromise with.

- [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts)
- [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)
- [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide)
